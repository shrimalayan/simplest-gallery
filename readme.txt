== Description ==


"Simplest Gallery Plugin" is the simplest way to integrate WordPress' builtin Photo Galleries into your pages with nice visual effects. 

Since v. 3.5.1, WordPress has got a new Gallery functionality which is great and lets you create, organize and place images galleries in your pages and posts with great ease.

This little plugin adds a flavor of magic to you galleries by seamlessly adding a fancybox jQuery effect to your galleries at no effort. You can add more gallery styles later if you want.

Just install, activate and experience the wonder of your WordPress galleries!

Note: Includes the free Lightbox FancyBox 2.1.5 by Janis Skarnelis - http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ (default, builtin gallery style)



== Installation ==

Ultra-simple:

1. Install from the WP administration interface: Plugins->Add New, and Activate
2. Create or edit any page or post. Insert a gallery into it by using the Wordpress builtin method ("Add Media" button).
3. View page and enjoy the gallery!

4. OPTIONAL: if you don't like how your galleries look like, go to WP Admin / Settings / Simplest Gallery and change the format of the gallery. You can add more gallery styles by adding extension plugins.
