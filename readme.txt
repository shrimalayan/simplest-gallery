== Description ==


"Simplest Gallery Plugin" is the simplest way to integrate WordPress' builtin Photo Galleries into your pages with a nice jQuery fancybox effect.

Since v. 3.5.1, WordPress has got a new Gallery functionality which is great and lets you create, organize and place images galleries in your pages and posts with great ease.

This little plugin adds a flavor of magic to you galleries by seamlessly adding a fancybox jQuery effect to your galleries at no effort.

Just install, activate and experience the wonder of your WordPress galleries!

Note: Includes a free Lightbox library redistributed under MIT license - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License 



== Installation ==

Ultra-simple:

1. Install from the WP administration interface: Plugins->Add New, and Activate
2. Create or edit any page or post. Insert a gallery into it by using the Wordpress builtin method ("Add Media" button).
3. View page and enjoy the gallery!

4. OPTIONAL: if you don't like how your galleries look like, go to WP Admin / Settings / Simplest Gallery and change the format of the gallery
